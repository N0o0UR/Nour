### Linear Regression Model

- To create a liner regression model to predict the height of a fish given its cross length, we need to determine the value of  \textrm{beta_0} that is the population parameter for the intercept and the value of $\beta_1$ that is the population parameter for the slope as shown in the following model:


 $$\widehat{Height}_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times Cross Length_{i}$$
